Only the latest released version of Commit+ receives security updates. Users are encouraged to always run the most recent release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Commit+ team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

📧 **trantienthanh2412@gmail.com**

Please include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof of concept
- The version(s) of Commit+ affected
- Any suggested fix, if applicable

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
- **Assessment**: We will investigate and confirm the vulnerability, then determine its impact and severity.
- **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate a release timeline.
- **Disclosure**: Once a fix is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

### Scope

This security policy applies to the Commit+ application ([Commit-Plus/macgit](https://github.com/Commit-Plus/macgit)). The following are **out of scope**:

- Vulnerabilities in the system Git executable itself
- Security issues in third-party dependencies (please report these to the respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks

## Security Best Practices

- Always download Commit+ from [official releases](https://github.com/Commit-Plus/macgit/releases/latest) or build from source.
- Keep your macOS and system Git up to date.
- Be cautious when opening untrusted repositories, as they may contain malicious configuration files (e.g., `.gitconfig`, hooks).
